## 1. What is VR

**Virtual reality (VR)** is a computer technology that use headsets, sometimes in combination with physical spaces or multi-projected environments, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulates a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the **artificial world**, and with high quality VR move about in it and interact with virtual features or items. VR headsets are head-mounted goggles with a screen in front of the eyes. Programs may include audio and sounds through speakers or headphones.

VR systems that include transmission of vibrations and other sensations to the user through a game controller or other devices are known as **haptic systems**. This tactile information is generally known as force feedback in medical, video gaming and military training applications. Virtual reality also refers to remote communication environments which provide a virtual presence of users with through telepresence and telexistence or the use of a virtual artifact (VA). The immersive environment can be similar to the real world in order to create a lifelike experience grounded in reality or sci-fi. Augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset, or through a smartphone or tablet device.

Paramount for the sensation of immersion into virtual reality are a high frame rate (at least 95 fps), as well as a low latency. Furthermore, a pixel persistence lower than 3 ms is required, because if not, users will feel sick when moving their head around.

## 2. VR in Geography

Virtual Reality in Geography covers 'through the window' VR systems, 'fully immersive' VR systems and hybrids of the two types. The authors examine the Virtual Reality Modeling Language approach, and explore its deficiencies when applied to real geographic environments.

 Also, you can see embeded 360 photo in this website. VR would be a cool way to show 360 photos and videos.

## 3. HTC Vive

Today we are going to use HTC Vive in Gaze. https://www.vive.com/us/product/

HTC Vive is a high end virtual reality headset developed by HTC and Valve Corporation, released on 5 April 2016. The headset is designed to utilize "room scale" technology to turn a room into 3D space via sensors, with the virtual world allowing the user to navigate naturally, with the ability to walk around and use motion tracked handheld controllers to vividly manipulate objects, interact with precision, communicate and experience immersive environments.
